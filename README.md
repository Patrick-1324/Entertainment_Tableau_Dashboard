## Overview
As a data analyst at BigScreen Insights, a consulting firm specializing in the movie industry, I had the opportunity to work with two comprehensive datasets: 'Movie Production Details' and 'Movie Revenue and Ratings'. The 'Movie Production Details' dataset provides insights into various aspects of movie production, including production companies, budgets, and genres. Meanwhile, the 'Movie Revenue and Ratings' dataset tracks the commercial performance and audience reception of these movies, offering data on their financial success and popularity.

In an industry where box office numbers and audience ratings significantly impact career trajectories, the task at hand was crucial. The objective was to delve into these datasets, uncovering patterns and insights that could redefine movie production and marketing strategies. This analysis aimed to not only benefit BigScreen Insights but also provide valuable guidance to clients in the movie industry.

## Objective
The mission was to leverage Tableau's robust capabilities to craft a compelling narrative from the provided datasets. This involved thorough data preparation, intelligent data modeling, and the skillful application of calculated fields and Tableau functions for sophisticated analysis. The ultimate goal was to develop an interactive and intuitive dashboard in Tableau that showcased key discoveries, offering concise, actionable insights to optimize movie production and marketing strategies.

## Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of 'Movie Revenue and Ratings' and 'Movie Production Details' datasets.
